                “After a war, we know there is this situation of post-traumatic stress from individuals who worked on the front to even the entire population involved in this process and who have a very exuberant and typical clinical condition with flashbacks, sleep disorders, feeling of anguish and physical feelings.”
            </p>
            <p class="lead text-center">
                “When there is a very big trauma and a critical situation that goes on, like a war, you have that adrenaline rush through the body in an acute situation, like a bomb that explodes, but in the long term you have a tonic release of cortisol.”
            </p>
            
            <p>
                &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspAccording to him, the release of hormones by the body, as a natural defense mechanism measure, can lead to memory lapses. “We know that there is a process as if it were a natural defense of the brain itself, which causes memory lapses and even amnesia, as if it were a way for you to be able to endure such pain to continue living".
            </p>
            <p>
                &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspTreatment can be carried out from psychological and psychiatric follow-up, with the use of medication when prescribed by the health professional. Other types of therapy consist of prolonged exposure and cognitive processing therapy, which are techniques linked to a process of putting the individual before the traumatic situation in a gradual way, with the objective of provoking desensitization in relation to the traumatic event. Family and social support also contributes to the prevention of post-traumatic stress disorder.

                "Depending on the country in which the refugee will be allocated, there may be a greater or lesser reception, or a more applied vision to this situation or not. In general, it ends up being the instruction and the recognition that this exists that makes us able to have better results”.
