                <em>"War is a place where the young kill one another without knowing or hating each other, because of the decision of old people who know and hate each other, without killing each other."</em> - Erich Hartman
            </p>
            <p>
                &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp During one of the chapters, we see Vladek being recruited as a soldier to serve his country against the growing Nazi threat. Initially, Vladek did not shoot, either because he had no experience in that type of military combat, or because of his own choice. But that changes when his commander forces him to fight.
            </p>
            <p>
                &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Vladek observes through the scope of his weapon, a 'tree' moving, and instinctively recognizes, it was an enemy. In a war, you will never stop to think "What is my enemy feeling? What does he want? Should we really be fighting each other?", he is a person who is fighting for the other side, and for honor and defense. of your country, you must kill him.
            </p>
            <p>
                &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp After shooting a few times, the man disguised as a tree falls and raises his hand, symbolizing a kind of surrender, but this doesn't stop, who shoots several times in a row, until that person dies. Looking from Vladek's perspective alone, this was the best thing to do, that person was an enemy, an enemy is a threat, and a threat must be eliminated.
            </p>
            <p>
                &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp But... For that man who had just lost his life, he was also fighting for his country, maybe out of obligation, maybe out of patriotism, but one doubt remains: "Was he wrong?", both Vladek and his enemy had a life own, a family, friends, a job, a history... During wars, human lives are just statistics. During World War II, it is estimated that between 70 and 85 million people died, a relatively small number for an event of a catastrophic global scale, given that the world population was about 2.3 billion people in 1940...
            </p>
            <p>
                &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspHowever, each of these people had a life story, they had a family to take care of, they had a whole life to write, and because of the choice of a few people in the world, they had all that abruptly stopped.
            </p>
            <p>
                &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp <em>"When the rich wage war, it's the poor who die."</em>, this phrase is by Jean-Paul Sartre, French philosopher, playwright and writer, and was published in a newspaper shortly after the end of the Second World War, and expresses much well the difference between waging a war and fighting a war. The powerful want to fight, but they never have the courage to face each other, after all... War kills, doesn't it? So, they force the weakest to fight for an ideal that is not even theirs, and often they are just amused by the results.
            </p>
            <p>
                &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Of course, there are exceptions, WWII itself had a madman aiming to forcibly override his own opinion, and that had to be stopped. Even so, not everyone who fought for it, was in agreement with the ideas they were fighting to defend, if you depend on a voluntary military power, your army is formed only by those have a huge will to fight, and of course will be great soldiers, but they are few. An exorbitant amount of people, free to die on the front lines as objects controlled by a general is clearly more efficient, after all, if they die, who cares?
            </p>
            <p>
                &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp During war, the value of a human life changes. It changes for nothing, because no one really cares about a soldier who died defending his country, other than all the people that person mattered to in life right? But we ignore that, after all, the feelings of these people don't matter, right?
            </p>
            <p>
                &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspDuring war, the value of a human life changes. And now, the human being hasno more value. If you 're a soldier and you die, you're just one more. One more for the statistics. You might even get a merit badge if you do something that will be remembered after the war, but what good is it? You are no longer a human, you are just a statistic.
            </p>
            <p>
                &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp During war, the value of a human life changes. But... What is the value of a human life?
